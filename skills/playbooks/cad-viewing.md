# CAD viewing and user-facing views

Unmeasured candidate agent guidance. The implementation is tested; this wording
has not been evaluated for agent tool-choice efficiency.

## Use the canonical viewer

Use AAD's packaged viewer for every CAD model. For HTML-only chat, export the
saved AAD scene with `python -m aad_platform.viewer.bundle SCENE_DIR OUTPUT_DIR`
and pass `viewer.html` to the host's HTML preview and display tools. Use its
`--title`, `--presentation` and `--views` options for inspection recipes. This
also works for an explicitly unverified inspection scene; it does not require
replacing the renderer when a build check fails.

Do not write a separate Three.js/WebGL viewer or copy an old stub to work around
missing MCP tools, a failed build, or HTML size limits. Unless the user explicitly
requests a different viewer, preserve AAD's controls, navigation and original
scene geometry. If the runtime is missing, repair the installation or report
the actual blocker.

When a viewer looks outdated, inspect the active Python environment and the
resolved asset before editing UI: `python -c "import sys; from aad_platform.viewer
import viewer_path; print(sys.executable); print(viewer_path())"` (one line).
An old editable checkout is a separate runtime from another checkout containing
new commits. Merging a PR does not update that environment or saved HTML files.
Regenerate the viewer bundle with the current runtime after updating it.

## Two interfaces, one original scene

Chat exposes orbit/pan/zoom, Pull apart/Put together, XYZ Grid, Reset, a wider
Views menu, and fullscreen. Small white-outlined icons sit beside the title.
Advanced CAD panels and action shortcuts are hidden. Local windows retain the
native CAD engine's full toolset; standalone exports can opt into CAD controls.

A slim loading bar appears during startup and model loading. It tracks received
bytes, stays active during geometry preparation, and disappears when ready.
There is no visible loading text or percentage; reduced motion is respected.

Grid planes, origin and extent stay anchored in world coordinates while the
camera moves. Only tick density changes with zoom, with hysteresis to prevent
flicker near thresholds. Labels retain their native axis orientation; overlapping
or offscreen labels are hidden, reserving space for the title and XYZ marker.

Hovering a part shows a muted `Part name · #number` line beneath the title.
The one-based number follows the original scene manifest, stays fixed across
views, and is revision-local. The label clears when hovering ends.

Chat highlights an entire part with a soft blue hover tint and a stronger blue
selection tint, preserving material and detail.
Click selects; clicking a selected part removes it from the selection. Shift-click
toggles additional parts; blank click and Escape clear selection. Camera drags do
not select. On a host advertising native composer insertion, double-click appends
an unsent `@part` reference to the active chat prompt. Current T3 HTML chat lacks
this API, so that action stays unavailable. No clipboard workflow or separate
request editor is offered, and nothing automatically sends or edits the model.

Native prompt references and selection context carry an exact identity URI:
`aad://part/<project>/<rev>/<scene_id>?path=<percent-encoded-leaf-path>`.
Resolve its project, revision, hash and path against `scene.parts` before editing.
The mention label is not a file or a globally unique identifier; duplicate names
receive distinct labels. The URI is not a modeling query selector. Reconcile older
revisions before changing a model. Clearing viewer selection does not remove a
reference already added to the user's prompt.

MCP Apps stage selected parts through advertised `updateModelContext` modalities
and clear that context on deselection or scene/revision changes. HTML-only hosts
do not share selection with the agent. Context may report `selectedCount` and
`omittedCount`; obtain omitted references before acting on those parts.

Composer insertion requires `hostCapabilities.experimental["openai/message"]`
and text-message support. Use `ui/message` with a titled text item carrying the
exact identity and `_meta: {"openai/message": {target: "active", send: false}}`.
Never use ordinary `ui/message` as a fallback: it can send immediately. Missing
support leaves insertion unavailable; a rejected request only reports failure.
See the [official OpenAI extension documentation](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/extensions).
Do not promise composer focus or support in a particular installed app without
its advertised capability.

Opening a scene, selecting a view, Reset, and resizing fit visible component
bounds to the current canvas, leaving room for the title controls and edges.

On Mac, click-drag rotates, two-finger scroll pans in both directions, pinch
zooms, and Option-scroll is the zoom fallback. Other desktops scroll or pinch to
zoom and Shift-drag or right-drag to pan.

| Capability | How agents prepare chat views / local CAD behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Components | `presentation.isolate` or `hide`; exact names and leaf/group paths from `scene.parts`. Native tree also controls faces/edges and selection. |
| Sections | `section.planes`: 1–3 XY/XZ/YZ or custom-normal planes, signed offsets from the model center in model units, optional flipped normals and intersection mode. Native Clip UI also exposes caps and plane controls. |
| Display | `style`: shaded-edges, shaded, wireframe, transparent. Native materials and edges remain available locally. |
| Camera | `view`: iso/front/rear/left/right/top/bottom; `projection`: orthographic/perspective. Native orientation marker, orbit, pan, and zoom. |
| Explode | Optional `explode` boolean in each recipe. Explode fits the pieces; collapse restores assembled framing. See Exploded layout. |
| Grid | Optional `grid` boolean, used only by the recipe that first presents a new scene. See Grid preference. Native CAD also controls individual planes and axes. |
| Measurement | Native mesh distance, properties, and picking in the local CAD window. Mesh measurements are not exact B-rep metrology. `aad_measure` may be unavailable; inspect its result. |
| Surface inspection | Native zebra, material, studio lighting, and Z scale in CAD mode. Remote environment-map fetches are excluded by the offline viewer contract. |
| Analysis | Named `analysis` views color whole components using supplied scalar summaries. A legend shows quantity, units, range, and source. No solver is provided by this viewer. |

Do not promise feature parity with all CAD software. Geometry editing and exact
CAD analysis remain separate from this display viewer.

## Provide a menu of views

Pass `views` to `aad_show`, alongside the reviewed revision and optional base
`presentation`, `view`, and `title`:

```json
{
  "project":"gearbox",
  "title":"Gearbox",
  "views":[
    {"id":"interior","label":"Interior","description":"Housing hidden","presentation":{"hide":["housing_upper","housing_lower"]}},
    {"id":"see-through","label":"See-through","presentation":{"style":"transparent"}},
    {"id":"gears","label":"Gear train","presentation":{"isolate":["/Group/gears"]}},
    {"id":"section","label":"Longitudinal section","view":"front","presentation":{"section":{"planes":[{"plane":"YZ","offset":0}]},"projection":"orthographic"}}
  ]
}
```

See-through uses `style: "transparent"`: translucent surfaces with edge lines
hidden. It retains every part unless the recipe also supplies visibility filters.

Use actual part names from `scene.parts`, not the example names. Each recipe is
complete and independent: absent visibility/style/section fields use the normal
whole-model display. Recipes do not inherit base filters. Original restores the
base presentation; Reset restores the currently selected recipe, apart from the
grid preference below. Repeating an
identical result preserves the selection; replacing recipes preserves its ID
when present and otherwise returns to Original. `views: []` clears the menu.
The same scene hash is reused without fetching or retessellating its geometry.

At most 24 recipes and 64 KiB of normalized recipe metadata are accepted. IDs
are unique `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` strings up to 64 characters; `original` is reserved.
Labels are unique, non-empty, at most 48 characters. Optional descriptions are
at most 240 characters. `presentation.inside` is a legacy alias for one Interior
recipe; new integrations use `views`.

## Grid preference

A new scene takes its grid from the initial recipe; `grid` absent means off. After
that, the grid belongs to the user. Views, Original, Reset, and same-scene
`aad_show` updates keep the exact XY/XZ/YZ planes and axes, whether on or off, and
ignore `grid` in those recipes. Use a recipe's `grid` only to set a new scene's
starting state, not to toggle the grid on a displayed scene.

## Exploded layout

Pull apart spaces coaxial components along the assembly axis and separates parallel
stacks. Original geometry and part orientation do not change. Auto-spacing is a
view layout inferred from bounding boxes. It is not a physical disassembly
sequence or collision proof, and parts can still overlap in a projection.

`presentation.materials` accepts up to 256 per-part `{parts, color, metalness, roughness, opacity}` overrides. Selectors resolve to exact scene paths; colors use `#RRGGBB`, scalar values range from 0 to 1. `presentation.environment: "studio"` applies a generated offline reflection environment. These settings affect display only.

## Analysis views: evidence before color

Add `analysis` only when actual result data exists:

- `quantity`: what the numeric values mean, e.g. Maximum von Mises stress.
- `units`: the units of those values, e.g. MPa.
- `source`: the actual result artifact or solver run, not a made-up citation.
- `values`: 1–2048 `{part, value}` records, resolved to unique scene part paths.
  Values must be finite; no part may be assigned twice.
- Optional `range: [minimum, maximum]` must contain every value. When omitted,
  bounds come from the supplied values.

Each component is uniformly colored by its supplied summary value. This is not
a pointwise stress field, displacement solution, or an FEA solver. Do not use
invented values to make a requested Stress menu entry appear. When results are
missing, say what is unavailable and offer supported geometric views. Keep
solver assumptions, load cases, boundary conditions, material evidence, and
revision association attached to the analysis source.

## Exports

MCP Apps use the original scene chunks. HTML-only exports split the saved scene into lossless RGB PNG chunks, reference each chunk once by absolute local path in `viewer.html`, verify their byte counts and overall SHA-256, and stop with an error if a chunk is missing. The HTML argument stays below 512,000 characters; export reports an error and points to `standalone.html` if the argument or host-specific inline limit is exceeded. For HTML-only chat, export with
`python -m aad_platform.viewer.bundle SCENE_DIR OUTPUT_DIR --views 'JSON'`.
Pass `viewer.html` to the host's HTML preview then display tools; supported
hosts inline its local SVG metadata assets losslessly. `standalone.html` works
offline; `--controls cad` enables native CAD controls only in that standalone
file. The chat artifact always stays simple. No preview server is needed.
Preserve original scene bytes, hash and triangle count. Never use mesh
simplification or coordinate rounding to get under a host's HTML size limit.

### Oversized HTML viewer fallback

`python -m aad_platform.viewer.bundle SCENE_DIR OUTPUT_DIR --open-on-limit`
writes the complete offline viewer first. If the 25 MiB inlined-size limit or
512,000-character argument limit is exceeded, this explicitly requested option
opens `standalone.html` in Safari on macOS, or the default browser elsewhere,
and returns its path. Browser launch failure reports the saved path as an error.
The Python `export_bundle(..., open_on_limit=True)` option has the same behavior.
Without the flag, oversized exports raise with the standalone path. An older
`viewer.html` in that output directory is removed on oversized export so it cannot
be mistaken for the current revision. Scene bytes are preserved. Use
`--controls simple` for the same controls as chat; `--controls cad` retains the
advanced CAD panels in a separate standalone export.

The simple Pull apart / Put together control animates component translations
and camera framing in both directions. A second click reverses an ongoing
transition from its current pose. Reduced-motion preference switches directly
to the requested pose. Reset and selecting another view cancel an unfinished
transition before applying the new recipe; scene bytes remain unchanged.
